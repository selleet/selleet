## Yet another shopping software

The initial purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to build a web application using TDD, BDD and DDD.

The domain of this e-commerce website will be a jewelry online shop.

The application will be divided into several bounded contexts:
 - Accounting (invoice, payment, ...)
 - Purchasing (shopping cart, ...)
 - Catalog (admin, ...)
 - Inventory (sku, ...)
 - Shipping (delivery form)
 - Customer Relation (customer)
 - After-sales service
 - Marketing
